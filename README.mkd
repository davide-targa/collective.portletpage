# Collective Portletpage

## Overview

After installing this product, you will be able to add a *Portlet Page*.

This is like a standard Plone Page, but it also has a "*Manage portlets*" tab, from which you may assign portlets into eight slots. The portlets will be shown on the main view of the content.

![Managing content's portlets](http://github.com/davide-targa/github_images/blob/master/collective.portletpage/edit.png?raw=true "Managing content's portlets")

Use of other content data like title, description and body text can be avoided, making the Portlet Page simply a portlet container. This product is great for providing to your Plone sites a tool for building the site *homepage*, or the home for a site subsection.
